			<p>This application couldn't be limited to a simple calendar or directory; it needed to be intuitive, fun, personalized, and social. Finding the best approach for each aspect of the application was seemingly easy, but we soon found ourselves with a convoluted problem with more needs than expected. After an initial failure to understand the task and what an experience on a cruise would/should look like, my partner and I eventually designed something that was holistic and minimalistic in its interface but allowed for complex interactions.</p>
 			<p>After being given two personas, we initially defined the two use cases for each one. To put it simply, families needed to discover events for their children and and have a way to contact the facilities manager, while "singles" could easily meet others and do activities with those with similar interests. Our biggest mistake when whiteboarding that effectively frustrated us and ineffectively solved our use cases was that we couldn't imagine all of the use cases under one, single system. As a result, we had the user choose the ship they were on, assuming that only families would be on one type of cruise ship and that singles would be on another, and the features they would have on the application would differ based on the ship they chose. Families could choose events based on their interests, and their schedule as well as a button to call the respective manager for each event would be on a single page. Singles had an additional feature however, forcing them to complete a profile and allowed them to "mingle" in a Tinder-esque manner to discover people with similar ages and interests.</p>
 			<p>But we didn't want to replicate Tinder, and we wanted our users to be off their phones and physically interacting with people constantly. But then, we also wanted users to collaborate and share their schedules with each other, paying close attention to time-sensitivity. While tackling those conflicting concepts of interactivity online and offline, we also struggled with designing a single interface for all users, regardless of what persona they fit. As I sketched repeatedly for the paper prototypes, we slowly built a nuanced solution. We limited our menu to only three main pages - notices, schedule, and party. <strong>Notices</strong> provided an information portal for events/activities to complete in that moment, announcements, and requests for the social interactions. <strong>Party</strong> allowed users to contact the individuals they arrived with as well as add new friends to their social circle on the ship, scanning their onboard wristband identifiers that connected them to their app. The idea of discovering people on the app? Too creepy and uncomfortable. Scrapped it and took advantage of the existing technology. <strong>Schedule</strong> was our most innovative feature and main page. By tapping different people in your party, you could view your own schedule and how it comapred to theirs, and to encourage our customers to constantly do things, we placed the area to add an event or activity to their plan in every open space of their schedule.</p>
 			<p>In our final interactive prototype, we made minor adjustments to differentiate friends met on the ship vs. the users' actual party, and allowed for invitatations to events, generally implementing more social features. <a href="http://tzysqu.axshare.com/">The prototype</a> I completed has Page Notes on the sidebar for more details.</p>
