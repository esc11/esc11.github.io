			<p>I was the sole designer for Solar Bear, an iOS application aimed at young children to instill environmental consciousness and introduce green habits. The goal of the game is to take care of the polar bear, Bearnard, by lowering CO2 emissions and keeping his environment clean. Paired with a solar panel and Arduino, the <i>"clean energy factory"</i> generates clean energy to keep CO2 levels low. Users can earn solar points by keeping the solar panel out in the sun to generate clean energy or by removing trash from Bearnard's water. Points can be exchanged for accessories to customize Bearnard's appearance. If the energy factory is neglected, CO2 levels will increase, smog will appear, the iceberg will shrink, and Bearnard will begin to panic!</p>

			<p>Given the few hours we had, we initially had difficulties defining the project scope. We knew how we wanted to introduce the risks and rewards involved: make the bear look uncomfortable to make the user feel the same discomfort, and provide a shop as incentive to keeping the bear healthy.</p>

			<p>However, we felt several pressures to include an education component as well as a way to develop a closer relationship to Bearnard, strengthening the need to keep him safe. From brainstorming fun facts about the environment to making the bear talk to the user with fun speech bubbles, we found ourselves being distracted from our main problem and our main goal. While we weren't able to implement or design all of the features we wanted to effectively change or encourage the change of behavior, such as contextualizing the information displayed, having the opportunity to explore ideas with the mentors available was certainly enlightening.</p>

			<p>As a team, we decided that we didn't want to focus on teaching kids about global warming, but instead simply introduce them to caring about the environment. If we can get the next generation to be more concerned about their planet and where it's headed, our future's going to be in a better place.</p>
