			<p>My partner and I have never bought a car before, so to say that we were merely lost when starting this project was an understatement. We did understand several other things, however, we knew that this application needed to be easy, fun, and interactive. In contrast to many other groups who relied on questionnaires, we spent hours brainstorming how to avoid a standard survey and filter system. After deciding that extracting data from the user was the most convenient way to understand their lifestyle and preferences, we chose Facebook as the best spot to gather user information.</p>

			<p>From analyzing the user's age, gender, education, employment history, likes, check-ins, and more, we assumed that we could determine the user's demographic and lifestyle. However, we still didn't have access to their car preferences, such as their budget and seating capacity. We played with the idea of an "assembly line" questionnaire, animating a car being built step-by-step after every question involved. This would transform the dull questionnaire to an entertaining animation that implied progress - the user's "dream car" being built. Additionally, we had the idea of making the options for the questions limited to vector images instead of large amounts of text to further the ease of use.</p>

			<p>Although our concepts and sketches for the questionnaire were thoroughly developed, we decided to eliminate the idea entirely and instead focus on the concept of a seemingly "magic" experience. From critiques on our paper prototypes and usability tests with our first clickable prototypes, we designed a product that surrounded the concept of a "magic-8 ball", requiring very little effort on the user's part. After connecting the user's social media account to the Carmax application, the data would be analyzed, and the user would be presented cars sorted by compatibility. If the results are unsatisfactory, they can be "fine-tuned" by filtering with sliders, or they can try their luck even further by shaking their phone for a random result.</p>
