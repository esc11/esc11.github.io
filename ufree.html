			<p>My team chose to highlight the problem of college students' loneliness and sense of isolation. Through our research and interviews with students, we found that the root of the problem was not what we had anticipated. Students expressed that their friendships were often short-term and dependent on circumstance, and once they changed living situations or attendance in student organizations, friendships grew distant and became restricted to small talk.</p>

			<p>We had several iterations involving friends being matched up for events they were both interested in and another application that streamlined the planning process for hang-outs. Though, we discovered through additional interviews that college students weren't too interested in the future; they were more vested and more flexible with the present. </p>

			<p>Our solution ended up being a mobile application that displays contacts' availability statuses in real-time, allowing users to add their weekly schedule and select who sees their availability. Further tests with our prototypes prompted us to add an additional social component to encourage users to contact each other as well as the ability to see who was going to be free within the next hour and their duration of free time.</p>

			<p>I was responsible for designing the prototypes on Axure and writing the application details of the design specification. <a href="http://students.washington.edu/esc11/info360/chin-process-book.pdf">My process book</a> further outlines our iterations, my contribution, and how we made our design choices.</p>
