			<p>My team chose to highlight the problem of college students' loneliness and sense of isolation. Through our research and interviews with students, we found that the root of the problem was not what we had expected. Instead of the problem being founded in college adjustment or being overwhelmed by the size of the school, it was associated with the students' lack of time to be intentional about their relationships. We had several iterations involving friends being matched up for events they were both interested in and another application that streamlined the planning process for hang-outs. We found that college students weren't too interested in the future, though; they were more vested and more flexible with the present.</p>
			<p>To provide a solution for maintaining and strengthening friendships, we designed a mobile application that displays contacts' availability statuses in real-time, allowing users to add their weekly schedule and select who sees their availability. Further tests with our <a href="http://students.washington.edu/esc11/info360/chin-process-book.pdf">prototypes</a> prompted us to add an additional social component to encourage users to contact each other as well as the ability to see who was going to be free within the next hour and their duration of free time.</p>
			<p>I was responsible for designing the prototypes on Axure and writing the application details of the design specification. My process book further outlines our iterations, my contribution, and how we made our design choices.</p>
