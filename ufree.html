			<p>My team chose to highlight the problem of college students' loneliness and sense of isolation. Through our research and interviews with students, we found that the root of the problem was not what we had expected. By asking, "What is the best way to make meaningful relationships?", the entire tone of the interview changed. Students expressed that their friendships were often short-term and dependent on circumstance, and once they changed living situations or attendance in student organizations, friendships grew distant and became restricted to small talk.</p>
			<p>Communication between the team was especially difficult - as each of us looked at different problems, we came up with different solutions with no clear agreement. One of my team members stated that it was too much of a challenge to find a solution to strengthening existing friendships; how can an application foster intimacy and force students to have better relationships with each other? That seemed impossible, but what was possible was to create a way for students to meet new friends. However, I firmly believed that that would contradict our entire problem - students already had avenues to meet new people but lacked opportunities to be intentional and further those surface-level relationships.</p>
			<p>We had several iterations involving friends being matched up for events they were both interested in and another application that streamlined the planning process for hang-outs. Though, we discovered through additional interviews that college students weren't too interested in the future; they were more vested and more flexible with the present. For me, this news was crushing as I was forced to emotionally distance myself from my design and scrap it. But as all designers do, I got over it, and we collectively decided on implementing the features related to present, real-time information.</p>
			<p>Our solution ended up being a mobile application that displays contacts' availability statuses in real-time, allowing users to add their weekly schedule and select who sees their availability. Further tests with our prototypes prompted us to add an additional social component to encourage users to contact each other as well as the ability to see who was going to be free within the next hour and their duration of free time.</p>
			<p>I was responsible for designing the prototypes on Axure and writing the application details of the design specification. <a href="http://students.washington.edu/esc11/info360/chin-process-book.pdf">My process book</a> further outlines our iterations, my contribution, and how we made our design choices.</p>
