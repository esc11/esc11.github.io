			<p>Surprisingly enough, a hospital review site didn't exist, so we built a website to search for hospitals in Washington by zip code, city, or hospital name, and once a user creates an account, they can post reviews about their visits. Reviews can still be viewed without an account. Data was retrieved from <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/hospitalcompare/About/What-Is-HOS.html">Medicare.gov</a>.</p>

			<p>While this project was more focused on development, we came across ethical issues when attemping to determine what aspects of a hospital a patient should judge. We could highlight how child-friendly, clean, inexpensive, efficient a hospital could be, but with an immense amount of data, it wasn't easy to narrow down what was needed and what may have been unnecessary. We were essentially deciding what a user should value in a hospital, and that was highly unsettling. Given the time constraint and the inability to extensively research, this project was disappointing to me - we couldn't identify clear personas and their values. That being said, it introduced me to what I <i>need</i> to study and define in future projects, and it motivated me to care more about the user.</p>

			<p>I was responsible for designing the interface, finding and parsing the data, and creating page for individual hospitals with the Google Maps API.</p>
